            <h2>Web Development Concepts</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                <!-- 1. Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
                <p>This file is named <code>index.html</code>, and it is the <strong>designated homepage</strong> of the <code>/~rootsl/a1-rootsl/</code> directory located on the OSU Engineering
                web server. When a web browser sends a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<strong>HTTP</strong>) request for the directory, the <strong>Apache</strong> web server, the software used by OSU Engineering, maps the request to this file. 
                The majority of web servers are configured to search for an <code>index.html</code> file whenever they receive a request for <code>/</code>, the <strong>root directory</strong>. On 
                some web servers, other file names are accepted as homepages. For example, Microsoft web servers will also look for <code>default.html</code> files.</p>
                <!-- 2. Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen. What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server versus the local computer? -->
                <p>The Inspection tools in web browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome allow users to view requests and responses between the <strong>web client</strong> and different servers. The network information
                can differ based on which <strong>protocol</strong> is used. When viewing the local file version of this webpage, the network information will show three resources: <code>index.html</code>, <code>main.css</code>, and <code>main.js</code>. 
                The general network information for the <code>index.html</code> file shows the Universal Resource Locator (<strong>URL</strong>), request method, status code, and referrer policy. It shows limited response and request headers as well.
                When the same file is accessed through a web server, the network information is quite different. An additional <code>favicon.ico</code> file is shown. The general tab includes
                a remote Internet Protocol (<strong>IP</strong>) address for where the server is located. The request and response headers are more detailed, showing information on the server, the user-agent, and time and date signatures.</p>
                <!-- 3. Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not. -->
                <p>When viewing the network tab for the file hosted on the OSU Engineering web server, four main resources are listed with different status codes. The <code>index.html</code> file and <code>favicon.ico</code> files
                have 200 status codes, meaning the files were found and retrieved successfully. The <code>main.css</code> and <code>main.jss</code> files are listed with 404 status codes, meaning the files were not found. The only file located
                in the <code>/~rootsl/a1-rootsl/</code> directory was <code>index.html</code>. The <code>main.css</code> and <code>main.jss</code> files are linked in the <code>index.html</code> file but are not provided or located on the web server.
                Upon inspection, the URL for the <code>favicon.ico</code> file is located inside the root directory of the <code>web.engr.oregonstate.edu</code> server. It is a file provided by the parent directory; therefore, it has a success status code.</p>
                <!-- 4. Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What is the scheme, the subdomain, the host domain, and the resource. -->
                <p>The URL of this webpage can be broken into four main components: the scheme, the subdomain, the host domain, and the resource. The <strong>scheme</strong> in this case is <code>https</code>, which means the web browser used a Secure HTTP
                protocol to access the requested resource. The <strong>subdomains</strong> are <code>web</code> and <code>engr</code>. These identify what part of the server the request should be sent to. The <strong>host domain</strong> or <strong>server name</strong>
                is <code>oregonstate.edu</code>. The server name identifies which machine, or server, the resource is hosted on. The Domain Name System (<strong>DNS</strong>) maps the server name to a machine-understandable IP address. Finally, the <strong>path to resource</strong>
                is <code>/~rootsl/a1-rootsl/</code>. This identifies where the server should look to find the resource.</p>

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                <!-- 1. Explain the concept of frontend design, in a <p> paragraph.-->
                <p><strong>Frontend design</strong> refers to the portion of web development focused on the user experience. It involves designing the visual components of an application, including the styling via CSS, the Graphical User Interface (<strong>GUI</strong>), 
                and any interactive experiences via JavaScript. Any aspect of a program that interfaces with a user involves front-end design. Key considerations are having a consistent theme, an easy-to-understand interface, and an overall design that is interesting and enjoyable.
                The measure of how well a system uses each of those components is called <strong>usability</strong>.</p>
                <!-- 2. Explain the five "E"s of usability, in a <dl> definition list that separates the topics and descriptions. -->
                <p>The five "E"s of usability are:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Effective</dt>
                    <dd>How well are users able to complete any task?</dd>
                    <dt>Efficient</dt>
                    <dd>Are users able to complete their tasks quickly & easily?</dd>
                    <dt>Easy to navigate</dt>
                    <dd>Are new and experienced users able to find and remember where they need to go?</dd>
                    <dt>Error-free</dt>
                    <dd>Are users able to complete their tasks without encountering errors? Are all accessibility concerns addressed?</dd>
                    <dt>Enjoyable or engaging</dt>
                    <dd>Do users enjoy using the product? Does it appeal to the intended audience?</dd>
                </dl>
                <!-- 3. Explain the purpose of each of the page layout tags, in a <p> paragraph. -->
                <p>Page layout tags are <strong>block-level</strong> elements that help organize content on a page. While they visually function the same by blocking off sections with a <strong>newline</strong>, they also have functional purposes. The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag
                is used for the banner at the top of a page, which typically stays consistent throughout the entire site. It will typically include the name of the site and marketing materials such as a logo or slogan. The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tag provides links to other webpages and 
                a search bar. The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag holds the main body of content on a webpage. Inside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element are <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements that group content thematically. A <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> typically has a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
                headline and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> elements. An <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> typically has a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> headline and content over a single topic. Articles often have an <strong>ID</strong> selector for navigation and styling purposes. Other page layout
                components include <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> elements for floating content, <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> elements for media, and <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> elements for long quotations. Outside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element is the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> for
                copyright and contact information. A final page layout component is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, which is used as a basic divider and a placeholder for dynamic content.</p>
                <!-- 4. Explain how anchors link to external content, internal content, and from page-to-page, in an <ol> ordered list. -->
                <p><strong>Anchor</strong> elements <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> are used to link to various locations. They will include an <strong>attribute</strong> that provides where the anchor will link to and text in between the opening and closing tags that will describe the link that the user will click. 
                Anchor tags can be used to link to these different types of content:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>External content through a URL, such as <code>&lt;a href="https://example.com/"&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;</code>, which will display the highlighted text "Example" and link the user to the https://example.com website.</li>
                    <li>Internal content through ID tags, such as <code>&lt;a href="#article1"&gt;Article 1&lt;/a&gt;</code>, which will display the highlighted text "Article 1" and link the user to the element on the page with the id article1.</li>
                    <li>A new page within the site itself through either <strong>relative</strong> or <strong>absolute</strong> paths. Since there is another page in this directory called <code>contact.html</code>, it could be reached through <code>&lt;a href="contact.html"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
                </ol>
